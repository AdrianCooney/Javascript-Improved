#Javascript Improved#
This simple library is my take on improving and adding to some of Javascript's functionality. I am in no way hatin' on Javascript but I find myself writing the same stuff over and over, so I decided to just contain it in a syntax I'd like to use.

What I have (maybe) improved/added so far:
*	Random function
*	Conversion of Degrees/Radians
*	Loops 
*	Extending Objects
*	typeof
